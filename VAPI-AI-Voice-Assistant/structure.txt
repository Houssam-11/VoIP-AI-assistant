### Frontend (React + Vite)
The frontend is a React application built with Vite, located in the `/frontend` directory. Key components include:

1. **Main Structure**:
- `src/App.jsx`: Main application component with routing setup
- `src/main.jsx`: Application entry point
- `src/ai.js`: VAPI AI integration configuration

2. **Key Features**:
- User authentication (Login/Register)
- Separate dashboards for users and admins
- Interview management system
- Real-time voice interaction components

3. **Components Organization**:
- `src/pages/`: Contains main page components
- `src/call/`: Voice call related components
- `assets/`: Static assets and images

### Backend (Flask)
The backend is a Flask application located in the `/backend` directory, providing:

1. **Core Features**:
- RESTful API endpoints
- JWT-based authentication
- PostgreSQL database integration
- VAPI.ai integration for voice calls

2. **Database Models**:
- User management
- Admin management
- Interview history tracking
- Conversation data storage

3. **Key Endpoints**:
- Authentication endpoints (`/login`)
- Interview management (`/interview-history`, `/save-interview`)
- Admin-specific endpoints (`/admin/*`)
- Call management (`/call-details`)

The application uses a modern stack with:
- Frontend: React 19, React Router, VAPI AI Web SDK
- Backend: Flask, SQLAlchemy, JWT, PostgreSQL
- Development tools: ESLint, Vite

The architecture follows a clear separation between frontend and backend, with the frontend handling the UI and user interactions while the backend manages data persistence and business logic.
